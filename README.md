🏭 Efficient Warehouse Management Using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning


This project explores how multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) can optimize warehouse operations through decentralized coordination between autonomous robots.
Inspired by systems like Amazon Robotics, the project simulates a dynamic warehouse environment where multiple agents collaborate to manage item pickups, deliveries, and navigation efficiently.

By leveraging MARL algorithms such as DQN, PPO, and MADDPG, the system aims to improve throughput, reduce idle time, and demonstrate adaptive decision-making in uncertain logistics scenarios.

🚀 Objectives

Simulate a multi-robot warehouse environment.

Implement and compare multiple RL algorithms (DQN, PPO, MADDPG).

Enable decentralized coordination among agents.

Visualize real-time cooperative robotic behavior in dynamic warehouse conditions.

Evaluate performance using metrics such as delivery efficiency, collision rate, and task completion time.
